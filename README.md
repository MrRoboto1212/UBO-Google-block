Stolen from https://github.com/nickspaargaren/no-google

Quickly modified to work on uBlock Origin. This is a blanket anti-Google filter, meaning no YouTube, no Drive, nor any other Google website. If you want to use these, use an alternative or temporarily disable the filter entirely. (Personally, I find the latter easier than editing out every line related to these unique sites. Currently no way of whitelisting specific sites underneath individual filters.) Also uploading images on web Discord breaks due to googleapis. Captchas can have the potential to break on any website, though personally I have not had this yet. 

Websites will load faster when using this. 

EDIT: Actually around 99% functional. URLs/lines w/o || nor ^, just the plain link, are still being blocked when trying to visit them. UBO assumes you want a network block on the link.
