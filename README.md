Stolen from https://github.com/nickspaargaren/no-google

Quickly modified to work on UBlockOrigin. This is a blanket anti-Google filter, meaning no YouTube, no Drive, nor any other Google website. If you want to use these, use an alternative or temporarily disable the filter entirely. 

EDIT: Actually around 99% functional. URLs/lines w/o || nor ^, just the plain link, are still being blocked when visiting them. UBO assumes you want a network block on the link.
