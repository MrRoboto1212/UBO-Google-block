Stolen from https://github.com/nickspaargaren/no-google

Quickly modified to work on UBlockOrigin. This is a blanket anti-Google filter, meaning no YouTube, no Drive, nor any other Google website. If you want to use these, use an alternative or temporarily disable the filter entirely. (Personally, I find the latter easier than edting out every line related to these unique sites. Currently no way of whitelisting specific sites underneath individual filters.) Also web Discord breaks due to googleapis. Captchas will have the potential to break on any website. 

Websites will load faster when using this. 

EDIT: Actually around 99% functional. URLs/lines w/o || nor ^, just the plain link, are still being blocked when trying to visit them. UBO assumes you want a network block on the link.
